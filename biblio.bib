In the summer of 2003, the discharge from headwater streams of the Swiss Central Plateau was only 40{\%}-60{\%} of the long-term average. For alpine basins runoff was about 60{\%}-80{\%} of the average. Glacierized basins showed the opposite behavior. According to the degree of glacierization, the average summer runoff was close or even above average. The hydrological model PREVAH was applied for the period 1982-2005. Even if the model was not calibrated for such extreme meteorological conditions, it was well able to simulate the hydrological responses of three basins. The aridity index $\phi$ describes feedbacks between hydrological and meteorological anomalies, and was adopted as an indicator of hydrological drought. The anomalies of $\phi$ and temperature in the summer of 2003 exceeded the 1982-2005 mean by more than 2 standard deviations. Catchments without glaciers showed negative correlations between $\phi$ and discharge R. In basins with about 15{\%} glacierization, $\phi$ and R were not correlated. River basins with higher glacier percentages showed a positive correlation between $\phi$ and R. Icemelt was positively correlated with $\phi$ and reduced the variability of discharge with larger amounts of meltwater. Runoff generation from the non-glaciated sub-areas was limited by high evapotrans-piration and reduced precipitation. The 2003 summer heatwave could be a precursor to similar events in the near future. Hydrological models and further data analysis will allow the identification of the most sensitive regions where heatwaves may become a recurrent natural hazard with large environmental , social and economical impacts.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution atmospheric ensemble forecasting system is coupled to a hydrologic model to investigate probabilistic runoff forecasts for the alpine tributaries of the Rhine River basin (34 550 km2). Five-day ensemble forecasts consisting of 51 members, generated with the global ensemble prediction system (EPS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), are downscaled with the limited-area model Lokal Modell (LM). The resulting limited-area ensemble prediction system (LEPS) uses a horizontal grid spacing of 10 km and provides one-hourly output for driving the distributed hydrologic model Precipitation-Runoff-Evapotranspiration-Hydrotope (PREVAH) hydrologic response unit (HRU) with a resolution of 500 × 500 m2 and a time step of 1 h. The hydrologic model component is calibrated for the river catchments considered, which are characterized by highly complex topography, for the period 1997-98 using surface observations, and validated for 1999-2002. This study explores the feasibility of atmospheric ensemble predictions for runoff forecasting, in comparison with deterministic atmospheric forcing. Detailed analysis is presented for two case studies: the spring 1999 flood event affecting central Europe due to a combination of snowmelt and heavy precipitation, and the November 2002 flood in the Alpine Rhine catchment. For both cases, the deterministic simulations yield forecast failures, while the coupled atmospheric-hydrologic EPS provides appropriate probabilistic forecast guidance with early indications for extreme floods. It is further shown that probabilistic run-off forecasts using a subsample of EPS members, selected by a cluster analysis, properly represent the forecasts using all 51 EPS members, while forecasts from randomly chosen subsamples reveal a reduced spread compared to the representative members. Additional analyses show that the representation of horizontal advection of precipitation in the atmospheric model may be crucial for flood forecasts in alpine catchments. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

The impact of simple post-processing of the model forecast fields by up-, downscaling, and by grid box shifting is quantified.

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that hydrological models can be parameterised using a limited number of streamflow measurements. Citizen science projects can collect such data for otherwise ungauged catchments but an important question is whether these observations are informative given that these streamflow estimates will be uncertain. We assess the value of inaccurate streamflow estimates for calibration of a simple bucket-type runoff model for six Swiss catchments. We pretended that only a few observations were available and that these were affected by different levels of inaccuracy. The level of inaccuracy was based on a log-normal error distribution that was fitted to streamflow estimates of 136 citizens for medium-sized streams. Two additional levels of inaccuracy, for which the standard deviation of the error distribution was divided by 2 and 4, were used as well. Based on these error distributions, random errors were added to the measured hourly streamflow data. New time series with different temporal resolutions were created from these synthetic streamflow time series. These included scenarios with one observation each week or month, as well as scenarios that are more realistic for crowdsourced data that generally have an irregular distribution of data points throughout the year, or focus on a particular season. The model was then calibrated for the six catchments using the synthetic time series for a dry, an average and a wet year. The performance of the calibrated models was evaluated based on the measured hourly streamflow time series. The results indicate that streamflow estimates from untrained citizens are not informative for model calibration. However, if the errors can be reduced, the estimates are informative and useful for model calibration. As expected, the model performance increased when the number of observations used for calibration increased. The model performance was also better when the observations were more evenly distributed throughout the year. This study indicates that uncertain streamflow estimates can be useful for model calibration but that the estimates by citizen scientists need to be improved by training or more advanced data filtering before they are useful for model calibration.},

@article{Keller2019,
  abstract = {Scenario-neutral assessments of climate change impact on floods analyse the sensitivity of a catchment to a range of changes in selected meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation. The key challenges of the approach are the choice of the meteorological variables and statistics thereof and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed to achieve this, and it remains unclear if and to which extent they result in comparable flood change projections. Here, we compare projections of annual maximum floods (AMFs) derived from three different scenario-neutral methods for a prealpine study catchment. The methods chosen use different types of meteorological data, namely, observations, regional climate model output, and weather generator data. The different time series account for projected changes in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, in the occurrence statistics of precipitation, and of daily precipitation extremes. Resulting change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes differs in sign between the methods (range of −6{\%} to +7{\%} for flood peak magnitudes and −11{\%} to +14{\%} for flood volumes). Moreover, variability of projected peak magnitudes and flood volumes depends on method with one approach leading to a generally larger spread. The differences between the methods vary depending on whether peak magnitudes or flood volumes are considered and different relationships between peak magnitude and volume change result. These findings can be linked to differing flood regime changes among the three approaches. The study highlights that considering selected aspects of climate change only when performing scenario-neutral studies may lead to differing representations of flood generating processes by the approaches and thus different quantifications of flood change. As each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended to combine several scenario-neutral approaches to obtain more robust results.},

Here a method to make use of snowfall limit information-a standard output of limited-area models (LAMs)-for catchment-scale hydrological modeling is proposed. LAMs consider the vertical, humid, atmospheric structure in their snowfall limit calculations. The proposed approach is thus more physically based than inferring snowfall limit estimates based on (dry) ground temperature measurements, which is the standard procedure in most hydrological models. The presented case study uses forecast reanalyses from the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) limited-area model as input for discharge simulation in a topographically complex catchment in the Swiss Alps. Results suggest that the use of COSMO snowfall limits during spring snowmelt periods can provide more accurate runoff simulations than routine procedures, with practical implications for operational hydrology in Alpine regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} In steep and complex mountainous terrain, robust simulations of snow accumulation and ablation are crucial to a wide range of applications, especially those related to hydrology and ecology. Whilst new opportunities exist to integrate high-resolution spatio-temporal observations in the estimation of uncertain parameters in (a.k.a. “calibration” of) sophisticated, process-rich snow models, they have not yet been fully exploited. Here, with a view towards improving representations of snow and ultimately meltwater dynamics in rugged topography, a novel approach to the calibration of a high-resolution energy balance-based snow model that additionally accounts for gravitational snow redistribution is presented. Several important but uncertain parameters are estimated using an efficient, gradient-based method with respect to two complementary types of snow observations – snow extent maps derived from Landsat 8 images, and snow water equivalent (SWE) time-series reconstructed at two contrasting locations. When assessed on a per-pixel basis over 17 days that together encompass practically the full range of possible snow cover conditions, snow patterns were reproduced with a mean accuracy of 85{\&}thinsp;{\%}. The spatial performance metrics obtained compare favourably with those previously reported, whilst the temporal evolution of SWE at the stations was also satisfactorily simulated. Uncertainty and data worth analyses revealed that: i) the propensity for model predictions to be erroneous was substantially reduced by the calibration process, ii) pre-calibration uncertainty was largely associated with two parameters that were introduced to modify the longwave component of the energy balance, but this uncertainty was greatly diminished by calibration, and iii) the lower elevation SWE time-series was particularly valuable despite the comparatively small number of observations at this site. Alongside a gridded snowmelt dataset, commensurate estimates of firn melt, ice melt, liquid precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration were also produced. Our study demonstrates the growing potential of combining observation technologies and state-of-the-art inverse approaches to both constrain and quantify the uncertainty associated with simulations of alpine snow dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {Study region: This study focuses on a mountainous region experiencing urban sprawl and growing irrigation needs: the canton of Vaud (Switzerland). Study focus: Switzerland's description as Europe's water tower might evolve by the end of the century, as it should undergo significant hydro-climatic changes. Focusing on Western Switzerland is all the more important because a large part of the Swiss population lives in this area and because this region experienced water shortage episodes during the last decade. Climate change and its impacts on seasonal water resources availability and hydrological regimes were explored for the medium term (2050-2071). Flows were simulated based on a daily semi-distributed hydrological model. A calibration and corroboration procedure was performed over the 1984-2005 period. Future changes were derived from Swiss climate scenarios that rely on ten regional climate models. New hydrological insights for the region: By the 2060 horizon, the increase in temperature causes a higher ratio of liquid precipitation and a decrease in snow accumulation during winter. These variations give rise to earlier high flow peaks and more severe low flows. Hydrological regimes evolve and rivers become characterized by a pluvial regime. These seasonal hydro-climatic changes are of prior importance in an area where urbanization and irrigation keep increasing: the question arises on the capacity of water resources to meet future water demands.},

  abstract = {Better simulation and earlier prediction of river low flows are needed for improved water management. Here, a top-down structural analysis to improve a hydrological model in a low-flow simulation perspective is presented. Starting from a simple but efficient rainfall-runoff model (GR5J), we analyse the sensitivity of low-flow simulations to progressive modifications of the model's structure. These modifications correspond to the introduction of more complex routing schemes and/or the addition of simple representations of groundwater-surface water exchanges. In these tests, we wished to improve low-flow simulation while avoiding performance losses in high-flow conditions, i.e. keeping a general model.In a typical downward modelling perspective, over 60 versions of the model were tested on a large set of French catchments corresponding to various low-flow conditions, and performance was evaluated using criteria emphasising errors in low-flow conditions. The results indicate that several best performing structures yielded quite similar levels of efficiency. The addition of a new flow component to the routing part of the model yielded the most significant improvement. In spite of the close performance of several model structures, we conclude by proposing a modified model version of GR5J with a single additional parameter. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Information on possible changes in future flood risk is essential for successful adaptation planning and risk management. However, various sources of uncertainty arise along the model chains used for the assessment of flood risk under climate change. Knowledge on the importance of these different sources of uncertainty can help to design future assessments of flood risk, and to identify areas of focus for further research that aims to reduce existing uncertainties. Here we investigate the role of four sources of epistemic uncertainty affecting the estimation of flood loss for changed climate conditions for a meso-scale, pre-alpine catchment. These are: the choice of a scenario-neutral method, climate projection uncertainty, hydrological model parameter sets, and the choice of the vulnerability function. To efficiently simulate a large number of loss estimates, a surrogate inundation model was used. 46,500 loss estimates were selected according to the change in annual mean precipitation and temperature of an ensemble of regional climate models, and considered for the attribution of uncertainty. Large uncertainty was found in the estimated loss for a 100-year flood event with losses ranging from a decrease of loss compared to estimations for present day climate, to more than a 7-fold increase. The choice of the vulnerability function was identified as the most important source of uncertainty explaining almost half of the variance in the estimates. However, uncertainty related to estimating floods for changed climate conditions contributed nearly as much. Hydrological model parametrisation was found to be negligible in the present setup. For our study area, these results highlight the importance of improving vulnerability function formulation even in a climate change context where additional major sources of uncertainty arise.},

  abstract = {Flood forecasting may be improved by coupling atmospheric and hydrological models. To investigate the current potential of such an approach in complex mountain watersheds, the authors carried out a number of combined high-resolution one-way driven model experiments to generate runoff hydrographs for seven extreme flood events which occurred in the Lago Maggiore basin between 1993 and 2000. The Alpine Ticino-Verzasca-Maggia basin (2627 km2) is located directly to the south of the main Alpine ridge embracing a great part of the drainage area of Lago Maggiore. For this basin, the grid-based hydrological catchment model WaSiM-ETH was employed to determine the continuous runoff hydrographs. In the model experiments, two different sets of meteorological input data were used: (1) surface observation data from station measurements and from weather radar, and (2) forecast data from five different high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with grid cell sizes between 2 and 14 km. This paper presents and compares selected results of these flood runoff simulations with particular attention to the experimental design of the model coupling. The configuration and initialization of the hydrological model runs are outlined as well as the down-scale techniques which proved to provide an adequate spatial interpolation of the meteorological variables onto the 500 m × 500 m grid of the hydrological model. In order to evaluate the various hydrological model results as generated from the different outputs from the five NWP models, some coupled experiments with 'non-standard' NWP model outputs have been carried out. In particular, the results of these sensitivity studies point to inherent limits of high-resolution flood runoff predictions in complex mountain terrain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Distributed hydrological modeling in alpine watersheds needs high-resolution (∼1 km in space, 1 h in time) rainfall input. Spatial resolution of operational numerical weather forecast or regional climate models is coarser by at least one order of magnitude. Stochastic downscaling of meteorological model output is the appropriate way to bridge this scale gap. This study examines radar data in an orographically complex area in the southern European Alps by multiplicative multiresolution decomposition. Multiresolution rainfall fluctuations exhibit simple scaling characteristics. This result motivates the implementation of a spatial downscaling model, an example of an anisotropic microcanonical multiplicative random cascade, that is applied and evaluated. Necessity and skill of downscaling is illustrated by hydrological modeling of four heavy precipitation events in an Alpine watershed (total area of 2627 km2) with the grid-based model WaSiM-ETH. Downscaling of rainfall fields with 16 km grid spacing to fields with 1 km grid spacing improves the simulated event-mean runoff by 5-10{\%} and the peak runoff by up to 20{\%}.},

The methodology of climate change impact modelling is developed and illustrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps that uses the. discharge of a highly glacierised catchment. The potential climate change impacts are analysed in terms of system performance for the control period (1961-1990) and for the future period (2070-2099) under a range of climate change scenarios. The system performance is simulated through a set of four model types, including the production of regional climate change scenarios based on global-mean warming scenarios, the corresponding discharge model, the model of glacier surface evolution and the hydropower management model. The modelling uncertainties inherent in each model type are characterised and quantified separately. The overall modelling uncertainty is simulated through Monte Carlo simulations of the system behaviour for the control and the future period. The results obtained for both periods lead to the conclusion that potential climate change has a statistically significant negative impact on the system performance.},

  abstract = {Precipitation time series with high temporal resolution are desired for hydrological modelling and flood studies. Yet the choice of an appropriate resolution is not straightforward because the use of too high a temporal resolution increases the data requirements, computational costs and, presumably, associated uncertainty, while performance improvement may be indiscernible. In this study, the effect of averaging hourly precipitation on model performance and associated uncertainty is investigated using two data sources: station network precipitation (SNP) and radar-based precipitation (RBP). From these datasets, time series of different temporal resolutions were generated, and runoff was simulated for 13 pre-alpine catchments with a bucket-type model. Our results revealed that different temporal resolutions were required for an acceptable model performance depending on the catchment size and data source. These were 1–12 h for small (16–59 km2), 3-21 h for medium (60–200 km2), and 24 h for large (200–939 km2) catchments.},

  abstract = {Extreme floods are commonly estimated with the help of design storms and hydrological models. In this paper, we propose a new method to take into account the relationship between precipitation intensity (P) and air temperature (T) to account for potential snow accumulation and melt processes during the elaboration of design storms. The proposed method is based on a detailed analysis of this P-T relationship in the Swiss Alps. The region, no upper precipitation intensity limit is detectable for increasing temperature. However, a relationship between the highest measured temperature before a precipitation event and the duration of the subsequent event could be identified. An explanation for this relationship is proposed here based on the temperature gradient measured before the precipitation events. The relevance of these results is discussed for an example of Probable Maximum Precipitation-Probable Maximum Flood (PMP-PMF) estimation for the high mountainous Mattmark dam catchment in the Swiss Alps. The proposed method to associate a critical air temperature to a PMP is easily transposable to similar alpine settings where meteorological soundings as well as ground temperature and precipitation measurements are available. In the future, the analyses presented here might be further refined by distinguishing between precipitation event types (frontal versus orographic).},

@article{Staudinger2017,
  abstract = {One of the most important functions of catchments is the storage of water. Catchment storage buffers meteorological extremes and interannual streamflow variability, controls the partitioning between evaporation and runoff, and influences transit times of water. Hydrogeological data to estimate storage are usually scarce and seldom available for a larger set of catchments. This study focused on storage in prealpine and alpine catchments, using a set of 21 Swiss catchments comprising different elevation ranges. Catchment storage comparisons depend on storage definitions. This study defines different types of storage including definitions of dynamic and mobile catchment storage. We then estimated dynamic storage using four methods, water balance analysis, streamflow recession analysis, calibration of a bucket-type hydrological model Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), and calibration of a transfer function hydrograph separation model using stable isotope observations. The HBV model allowed quantifying the contributions of snow, soil and groundwater storages compared to the dynamic catchment storage. With the transfer function hydrograph separation model both dynamic and mobile storage was estimated. Dynamic storage of one catchment estimated by the four methods differed up to one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the storage estimates ranked similarly among the 21 catchments. The largest dynamic and mobile storage estimates were found in high-elevation catchments. Besides snow, groundwater contributed considerably to this larger storage. Generally, we found that with increasing elevation the relative contribution to the dynamic catchment storage increased for snow, decreased for soil, but remained similar for groundwater storage.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigated the application and the transferability of the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a partly glacierized Alpine catchment characterized by extreme climatic conditions and steep terrain. The model was initially calibrated for the 10 km2 watershed of the Damma glacier Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) in central Switzerland using monitoring data for the period of 2009- 2011 and then was evaluated for 2012-2013 in the same area. Model performance was found to be satisfactory against both the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (NS) and a benchmark efficiency (BE). The transferability of the model was assessed by using the parameters calibrated on the small watershed and applying the model to the approximately 100 km2 catchment that drains into the hydropower reservoir of the G{\"{o}}scheneralpsee and includes the Damma glacier CZO. Model results were compared to the reservoir inflow data from 1997 to 2010 and it was found that the model predicted successfully snowmelt timing and autumn recession but could not accurately capture the peak flow for certain years. Runoff was slightly overestimated from late May to June, when it is dominated by snowmelt. Finally, we investigated the response of the greater catchment to climate change using three different climate change scenarios, and the results were compared to those of a previous study, where two different hydrological models, PREVAH and ALPINE3D, were used. The methodology presented here, where SWAT is calibrated for a small watershed and then applied for a bigger area with similar climatic conditions and geographical characteristics, could work even under extreme conditions like ours. However, greater attention should be given to the differences between glacier melt and snowmelt dynamics. In conclusion, this assessment test on the transferability of SWAT on different scales gave valuable information about the strengths and weaknesses of the model when it was applied under conditions different to those under which it was calibrated.},
