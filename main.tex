\begin{abstract}
Hydrology plays a central role in applied and fundamental environmental sciences, but it is well known to suffer from an overwhelming diversity of models, particularly to simulate streamflow. We discuss here in detail how such diversity did arise based on the example of Switzerland. The case study's relevance stems from the fact that Switzerland, despite of being a small country, shows a variety of hydro-climatological regimes, of water resources management challenges and of hydrological research institutes that led to a model diversification that stands exemplary for the diversification that arose also at larger scales. Our analysis, based on literature review, personal enquiry and a author survey, summarises the main driving forces behind model diversification. The analysis shows that convenienceXXXX stands out as the main motivation for model selection in the past, but future pathways might emerge from facilitated collaboration through open sourcing and code-sharing platforms. We anticipate that this review not only helps researchers from other fields but in particular also the international hydrology community to understand why we have so many different models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%combS: below is not a good start for an international journal article, I would revert back, our start was nice for a wider audience; a paper that starts with a reference to SuppMat is really not nice; I would revert bakc to the original structure, that first states the problem
% I make a suggestion outside overleaf

The early times of hydrological modelling in Switzerland can be situated in the years 1970 to 1990, when model diversity naturally emerged in response to modelling needs\footnote{Additional details on the emergence of hydrological modelling in Switzerland are given in the Supporting Information}. From a hydrological processes perspective, a strong focus was on the simulation of snowmelt runoff \citep{Martinec1970, Braun1986} and glacier-melt runoff \citep{Braun1990}. Snowmelt modelling probably started with the work of \citet{Hoeck1952}, and modelling of snow runoff kept a strong influence on hydrological model development in the following decades (see Supporting Information). Another process-oriented focus was on understanding the role of forests in the water cycle \citep{Keller1991, Forster1989}. 

Along with modelling studies in experimental catchments \citep{Iorgulescu1994}, first model-based climate change \citep{Bultot1992a} and land-use change \citep{Jordan1990a} impact studies appeared. Quantitative real-time forecasts for water resources management \citep{Lugiez1969} and hydropower production \citep{Jensenlang1973} started being based on hydrologic models rather than statistical approaches. The work of \citet{Hottelet1993} is an early example of model adaptation to a specific catchment; they added three parameters to HBV-ETH to account for aspect dependent snowmelt and karst runoff for the Thur catchment.

On a global scale, the number of models keeps increasing at a fast pace, and it has become common to talk about the ``plethora of hydrological models'' \footnote{For a general dive into the history of modelling, the reader is referred to the work of Keith Beven \citeyear{Beven2020, Beven2020a}.}. Single models are branching out into numerous variants, such as the Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV; \citealp{Bergstrom1976a, Bergstrom1992, Bergstrom1995, Lindstrm1997})  that exists in multiple versions nowadays. Part of the model diversity in Switzerland resulted from the work of geoscientists and engineers not directly specialised in catchment hydrology \citep[][see Supplementary Information]{Abednego1990, Baumgartner1986a, Hager1984, Sautier1980}. 

It is worth noting that \citet{Naef1977} presented already a first model intercomparison study, comparing complex and simple models. In fact, model diversity already began to puzzle the research community in the late 1970ties and \citet{Naef1981} notably asked: ``But, given that the results are good, why do new models continue to be published?'' More recently, some authors claim that there are too many hydrological models, which might lead to a waste of time and effort, and that the hydrological community should gather on a Community Hydrological Model \citep{Weiler2015}.

While any newcomer to hydrological modelling will easily find some guidance on navigating the sheer diversity of hydrological models and understanding their concepts and limitations \citep{Beven2013, Solomatine2011, Kauffeldt2016}, the question of how this diversity has emerged receives much less attention. Existing historical analyses of model diversity \citep{Peel2020} generally focus on the technical evolution of model types. However, according to our personal experience, much of the knowledge about why many similar models have emerged is transferred informally.

One of the key drivers for the pronounced model diversity in hydrology is undoubtedly the wide range of model applications \citep{Weiler2015} that all require \textit{appropriate modelling}; this concept can be defined following \citet{Rosbjerg2005} as ``the development or selection of a model with a degree of sophistication that reflects the actual needs for modelling results''. Indeed, there is not a single valid model fitting every purpose \citep{Hamalainen2015}. Two well-accepted characteristics that models should exhibit are parsimony and adequacy to the problem at hand, i.e. a model should not be more complex than necessary and should be fit-for-purpose \citep{Beven2013}. In other words, the hydrological model diversification is strongly driven by the modelling context and by what is now often called \textit{uniqueness of place} \citep{Beven2000}. However, the hydrologic literature also offers other explanations, ranging from legacy reasons for model selection \citep{Addor2019} to a lack of agreement on concepts for process representations and to the simple wish to try to do better with yet another model parameterisation \citep{Weiler2015}.

We attempt here an analysis of what might explain the emergence of multiple hydrological models at a relatively small scale, the scale of Switzerland, a country small enough to do an exhaustive analysis but diverse enough to shed light on some of the most dominant drivers of model diversity. Despite Switzerland's small area (41285 km\textsuperscript{2}), numerous models are being developed and applied in the same contexts and often even for the same purpose and the same catchments.

Thus, this work aims to disentangle the motivations and reasons behind the choices that led to the current co-existence of a wide range of models. Our analysis relies on a literature review of hydrological modelling of Swiss catchments as well as on a survey conducted with 50 actors in this domain to assess the more informal and subjective drivers in model selection. We focus here on hydrological models (see Box 1) that simulate hydrological processes, including surface and subsurface flow and the resulting streamflow at the catchment scale. We exclude here models that simulate the water balance without providing streamflow at the catchment outlet. The hydrological models developed in Switzerland (Table \ref{tab:modelslist} and Appendix 1) range from rainfall-runoff (Box 1) models (PREVAH, GSM-SOCONT, RS, SEHR-ECHO, WaSiM) to snow-based models (ALPINE3D), glacier-hydrology models (GERM) and water temperature models (StreamFlow). Some models have their origin outside Switzerland but are now actively being developed in Switzerland (HBV-light, TOPKAPI-ETH, SUPERFLEX) or were applied to Swiss case studies (CemaNeige-GR6J, LARSIM, VIC, SWAT, mHM).

%comBS: add justification of case study based on reviewer comment, I will make a suggestion
%An international interest will require at least a brief reasoning of how special or how this situation in Switzerland is. Would other small countries have a similar model diversity or is Switzerland special and maybe a good or bad example? An assumption underlying the choice of case study will shape whether at all and then how an international reader will look at this, i.e. searching for similarities or searching for a development to follow/aim. I think this needs to be clarified to create interest to a wider range of readers. At the moment I don't clearly find why a non-Swiss should read this.

%Response: The focus on Switzerland was a “choice of opportunity and feasibility”. The submitted manuscript version justifies the choice of Switzerland as a small scale example that illustrates all the drivers of diversification at larger scale; abstract: “Based on Switzerland's example, we discuss here in detail how such diversity did arise even at the scale of such a small country. (..); and in the introduction: “We attempt here an analysis of what might explain the emergence of multiple hydrological models at a rather small scale, the scale of Switzerland, a country small enough to do an exhaustive analysis, but diverse enough to shed light on some of the most dominant drivers of model diversity.”. 

%We agree that we did include an explicit assumption on how representative the case study is, nor did we conclude with a reasoning on how special / general the case is.

\subsection*{Box 1: What do we mean by hydrological model ?}
\label{box:1}

A hydrological model is an input-output model that simulates the evolution of water storage, water fluxes and potentially associated chemical and physical properties at the Earth's surface and subsurface, based on the water balance equation. The term ``rainfall-runoff model'' is often used for hydrologic models that simulate streamflow at a catchment outlet based on input time series of rainfall. The term ``rainfall-runoff'' stems from the early times when such models simulated how much water of a rainfall event ran off to the stream (rather than being stored in the catchment), i.e. ``runoff'' designated the part of rainfall that appears as streamflow \citep{WMO1992}. Nowadays, rainfall-runoff models are continuous simulation tools that simulate all components of streamflow (including baseflow), and the term ``runoff'' now designates the lateral (as opposed to vertical) movement of water (at the surface or in the subsurface) towards a river \citep{WMO2012}. Modern rainfall-runoff models further transform simulated hillslope-scale runoff to catchment-scale streamflow; some of them include instream routing. Such models can be generalised to precipitation-runoff models in the presence of snowfall. The term ``water balance model'' is sometimes used as a synonym for rainfall-runoff models \citep{Boughton2004}. The correcter term ``rainfall-streamflow'' model appeared rather early \citep{Young1991} but is to date (January 12, 2021) only used in 17 WebOfScience publications. Streamflow is in many papers called interchangeably ``discharge'' and sometimes even ``runoff'', which is a legacy effect.  \end{quote}


\section{Diversity drivers from the modelling context}
\label{sec:context}

The alpine environment is a complex system with specific processes playing a dominant role in the hydrological cycle. Accordingly, it is obvious that the characteristics of this landscape and its dominant natural processes have a prominent place in model development and selection. For example, PREVAH is presented by \citet{Anghileri2019} as being "specifically designed to capture hydrological processes that are important for catchments in complex terrain", and multiple similar statements can be found in the literature \citep{Verbunt2007, Zappa2007a, Koplin2010,  Brunner2019e}. This is also true for other models such as WaSiM \citep{Jasper2002, Jasper2003, Thornton2021} or HBV-light \citep{SikorskaSenoner2020}. 

Topography has a strong impact on the meteorological forcing, whether for precipitation, temperature, or solar radiation. The great variability of local conditions in alpine environments is a driver for an increased spatial resolution in hydrological models compared to regions with more gentle topography \citep{Gurtz2003}. Indeed, most models used and developed in Switzerland are semi-distributed or fully distributed. Very few applications rely on lumped models \citep[for example,][]{Keller2019a}.

While natural processes and characteristics of the landscape have an impact on model selection and development, the context of the model application will also have an important share in these, for example, if we think of constraints set in terms of computing efficiency for climate change impact studies on long periods or data assimilation for operational forecasting. We attempt here a clustering of modelling studies according to either the representation of key processes in the model (Sect. \ref{sec:context:processes}) or the influence of the application context (Sect. \ref{sec:context:application}) in various Swiss catchments (Fig. \ref{fig:map}).

The information sources considered in this analysis are as far as possible peer-reviewed articles with applications to hydrology. The articles were retrieved based on searches by authors (hydrologists in Switzerland) and keywords. While we tried to search all applications as exhaustively as possible, biases in the search and citing network effects are possible. Where necessary, conference proceedings, PhD theses, research and government reports are also included. A few models are exclusively used or developed in engineering companies, and these are not included here. Furthermore, our analysis focuses on catchment-scale modelling and excludes studies that focus on hydrogeological modelling \citep{Carlier2019} and those with a focus on urban hydrology \citep{Peleg2017} or urban hydrogeology \citep{Schirmer2013}. All articles are not directly referenced in this paper, but a complete table is available in the Supplementary material.

\subsection{Process-driven influences}
\label{sec:context:processes}


\subsubsection{Cryosphere-related processes}
\label{sec:context:cryosphere}

Contributions from snow and glaciers are key components of the alpine environment as they play a significant role in hydrological regimes through a temporal redistribution of water. These processes thus need to be accurately represented in the models, what can be achieved with different levels of complexity. For example, most hydrological models used in Switzerland rely on a simple temperature-index based snow routine \citep[see for example][]{Jenicek2018}. On the other end, ALPINE3D, which is built on the physically-based SNOWPACK model (\citealt{Bartelt2002, Lehning2002a, Lehning2002b}), has undoubtedly the most complex representation of snow processes among Swiss models. It allows analyses that require a fully distributed and physically-based approach to snow modelling, such as the influence of solar radiation patterns \citep{Comola2015a} or sophisticated algorithms for snow distribution and water transport within the snowpack \citep{Brauchli2017} on the catchment-scale hydrologic response, or the influence of snow processes on the soil moisture and streamflow \citep{Wever2017}.

In the context of climate change impact on snow processes, ALPINE3D was used by \citet{Bavay2009} to assess the future snow cover and the related discharge in two alpine catchments. The emphasis of ALPINE3D on snow processes drove the choice of the model. However, detailed comparisons between simple snow routines and ALPINE3D have not been conclusive so far with respect to climate change applications \citep{Kobierska2011, Shakoor2018}. Also, its physically-based approach to snow processes implies heavier computation, which can be a limitation for climate change impact studies using ensemble approaches or simulations on extended periods. Other uses of ALPINE3D in climate impact studies rely so far on a limited number of members \citep[climate scenarios or climate model chains;][]{Bavay2013, Marty2017}. Another complex snow routine has been implemented in WaSiM and was shown to provide reliable results for distributed snow simulations \citep{Thornton2021}. 

Most models developed in Switzerland have also a glacier module, even the bucket-type models, and are used to quantify the contribution of glaciers to the hydrological response of a catchment \citep[see for example][]{Verbunt2003, Zappa2007a, Uhlmann2013a}. Also, applications to glacierized catchments can drive further improvement of snow and glacier melt representation in the model \citep{Finger2011}. ALPINE3D was as well applied to glaciers by \citet{Hindshaw2011} to attribute the origin of systematic seasonal and diurnal variations in glacial stream water chemistry.

The impact of glacier retreat on hydrology is at the heart of many climate impact studies \citep{Horton2006, Schaefli2007b, Junghans2011, Addor2014, Finger2015, Etter2017}. This gave rise to the development of the GERM model \citep{Huss2016, Junghans2011, Farinotti2012, Finger2013}, which particularly focuses on glacier processes, and a new glacier retreat parameterisation scheme widely applied internationally \citep{Huss2010}, called $\Delta$h-parametrisation. However, the awareness of the important limitations stemming from the poor representation of glacier dynamics in hydrological models has triggered an increasing effort in incorporating glacier evolution models. A recent example of the technical implementation of the $\Delta$h-parameterisation in HBV-light, which defines the glacier thickness change at a certain elevation in response to an overall change in ice mass in given in \citep{Seibert2018}.



\subsubsection{Hydraulic infrastructures and hydropower operations}
\label{sec:context:infrastructures}

Streamflow in the Swiss Alps can be heavily influenced by anthropic infrastructures, such as water diversion and hydropower operations. Thus, specific modules have been implemented in several hydrological models to account for these aspects. For example, TOPKAPI-ETH was chosen by \citet{Fatichi2014} as it "is designed to account for hydraulic infrastructures such as reservoir and river diversions as well as for water withdrawals for irrigation and domestic/industrial water consumption". It was also used for studies targeting hydropower operations in a climate change context \citep{Fatichi2015b, Anghileri2018}. WaSiM has as well a module for hydropower activities \citep{Verbunt2005}.

Hydraulic infrastructures and hydropower operations are at the core of RS MINERVE, designed primarily for that application. On account of this, it was also used coupled with other hydrological models, such as PREVAH, to include these major influences on the system \citep{Andres2016, Stucki2018}.
 

\subsubsection{Sediment production and transport}
\label{sec:context:sediments}

A particular topic that deserves some focus is sediment transport modelling. The modelling of sediment sources, as well as transport capacity, requires models that yield reliable spatial patterns of hydrological processes, i.e. distributed models such as TOPKAPI-ETH, which has been modified to account for river bed erosion and deposition processes using a sub-grid modelling scheme \citep{Konz2011}. This modification allows the simulation of erosion and deposition patterns, sediment transport rates, and evolution of the channel slope. \citet{Battista2020a} later developed a new soil erosion and sediment transport module for TOPKAPI-ETH to investigate the effects of precipitation and surface erodibility and their spatial variability on sediment fluxes. This new module was then used by \citet{Battista2020} to analyse the role of localised sediment sources, such as incised areas and landslides. They conclude that accounting for localised sediment sources improves sediment transport modelling and allows sediment sampling optimisation and sediment provenance studies.

Sediment management, for example, in the context of hydropower production \citep{RaymondPralong2015, Gabbud2016}, is gaining importance in Alpine countries and will most likely drive the development of new modules to simulate the interplay of hydrological and geomorphological processes at the catchment scale. In Switzerland, climate change is expected to decrease the sediment yield on average due to reduced runoff in summer and to shift the sediment transport regime to earlier months \citep[as found by ][using PREVAH]{RaymondPralong2015}.


\subsubsection{Ecohydrology}
\label{sec:context:ecohydrology}

Ecohydrology studies the feedbacks between ecosystems, in particular with vegetation and the water cycle \citep{Tague2020}. To date, catchment-scale studies with ecohydrological models accounting for feedback with vegetation are scarce in Switzerland. An early example is a work of \citet{Zierl2005}, who used the model RHESSys to study climate and land-use change impacts on alpine streamflow in Switzerland. Later, \citet{Fatichi2012, Fatichi2012a} developed an ecohydrological model, called Tethys-Chloris (T\&C), to simulate vegetation-hydrology interactions at large scales. It has been applied to catchments in Switzerland to study soil moisture spatiotemporal dynamics \citep{Fatichi2015a}, as well as to assess the vulnerability of Alpine ecosystems to climate change \citep{Mastrotheodoros2019}.

Another approach consists in coupling ecosystem models to distributed hydrological models, such as TOPKAPI-ETH for the analysis of the interactions between rivers, aquifers and ecosystems \citep{Foglia2009, Pappas2015}, or PREVAH for the assessment of the climate change impact on brown trouts \citep{Junker2015}. The impact of vegetation changes on streamflow can also be to some extent modelled as a change in land use, such as done in several analyses of forest change by \citet{Koplin2013} and \citet{Schattan2013} with PREVAH and by \citet{Alaoui2014} with WaSiM.


\subsubsection{Agricultural water use and water quality}
\label{sec:context:agriculture}

There are very few studies on agricultural water use, a topic that will likely gain importance in the future due to an expected decrease in water availability in summer. WaSiM has been shown to be suitable to study the demand and supply of water for agriculture, including irrigation \citep{Fuhrer2012}. Here we expect internationally widely used models might see more applications in Switzerland. One such example is SWAT, which - given its user-friendliness \citep{Abbaspour2007} - is likely to see more applications in Switzerland despite not being specifically designed for alpine environments \citep{Rahman2014, Andrianaki2019}. It has also been used to study land management effects \citep{Zarrineh2018}, the joint effect of land use and climate change \citep{Rahman2015}, and the impact of climate change on streamflow, erosion, and agriculture \citep{Zarrineh2020}.

Water quality studies require models able to simulate transport of chemicals \citep{queloz2015}, nutrients \citep{Abbaspour2007} and pollutants, or water temperature \citep{Michel2020}. \citet{Abbaspour2007} tested SWAT for modelling water quality and nutrient loads in the Thur catchment and concluded that "in watersheds similar to Thur – with good data quality and availability and relatively small model uncertainty – it is feasible to use SWAT". 


\subsection{Application-driven influences}
\label{sec:context:application}


\subsubsection{Analysis of model behaviour and uncertainty analysis}
\label{sec:context:uncertainty}

A large body of the hydrologic modelling literature focuses on a better understanding of model behaviour and, in particular, of model performance with respect to reproducing observed streamflow, e.g. as a function of model parameterisations, of spatio-temporal model resolution \citep{Brunner2019}, of precipitation input data \citep{Sikorska2016, Sikorska2017, MullerThomy2019}, or parameter estimation techniques \citep{Foglia2009, Cullmann2011}. However, in the context of model diversity, this field of research has overall little impact because most modelling groups who work on such theoretical aspects often use their in-house models for proofs of concepts or to improve them (e.g. \citealt{Schaefli2007, Hingray2010}).

Model performance studies cover, for example, the integration of glacier mass balance data \citep{Finger2015, Schaefli2011}, snow data assimilation \citep{Griessinger2016}, accounting for streamflow observation uncertainty \citep{Westerberg2020}, the influence of spatial or temporal resolution of hydro-meteorological input \citep{GironsLopez2016, Felder2017, Sikorska2018}, integration of citizen science data \citep{Etter2020}, error correction in forecasting chains \citep{Bogner2018}, assessment of spatial pattern reproduction of soil moisture and evapotranspiration \citep{Rossler2010, Zappa2003} and of snow \citep{Zappa2008a}, and the comparison of various climate postprocessing methods \citep{Rossler2019}.

Overall, there are only a few parameter regionalisation studies. An interesting example is the work of \citet{Viviroli2015}, where building up on a previous study by \citet{Viviroli2009c} the authors investigated the benefit of a combination of parameter regionalisation and short-term runoff measurements for catchments without extensive data, and highlighted the value of field measurements in mountain areas, acting as a counterbalance to the sparse operational observation networks.. Another example is the work of \citet{Melsen2016}, who applied the internationally used VIC model to the Thur catchment to assess the impact of parameter transfer over different temporal and spatial resolutions, showing that the overlap
in parameter sets for different spatial resolutions was much
larger than for different temporal resolutions.


\subsubsection{Characterisation and quantification of floods and droughts}
\label{sec:context:floodsdroughts}

Infrastructure planning, water resources and natural risk management heavily rely on probabilistic quantifications of extremes, i.e. an estimation of what could happen in terms of floods and droughts and their associated probabilities (called return periods in hydrology). Work in this field continues to be based on statistical analyses and extrapolation of observed streamflow time series \citep{Brunner2018, Asadi20108}, but hydrological models play an ever-increasing role to complement missing or insufficient streamflow data.

Any model-based flood estimation method is computationally intensive since long model simulation runs are required at an hourly time step \citep[see][about reducing computational requirements for extreme flood estimation by hydrological modelling]{SikorskaSenoner2020}. Accordingly, simple models such as PREVAH \citep{Viviroli2009, Viviroli2009c, Felder2017}, HBV-light \citep{Sikorska2017, Brunner2019a, SikorskaSenoner2020} and  RS MINERVE \citep{Bieri2013, Zeimetz2017, Zeimetz2018} are often used for flood estimation; these models are all deemed to perform well enough for flood estimation in Swiss catchments by their respective authors and users. Furthermore, at the time of writing, the open-source DECIPHeR model is further developed and implemented for Swiss catchments to bring diversity in the type of models used for flood modelling (Kauzlaric, personal communication).

Other more complex distributed models, such as WaSiM, are also used for flood modelling, but more often on an event-based temporal scale, as in the case of a reconstruction of the 1816 Tambora eruption and its impact on floods in the upper Rhine basin \citep[see Fig. \ref{fig:map};][]{Rossler2018}. Such a model can be highly relevant to study specific flood types that involve a good physical parameterisation of small scale processes, such as rain-on-snow flood events, as in the study by \citet{Rossler2014}. Despite relatively long simulation time, WaSiM has also been used to model more extended periods as in the assessment of climate change impacts on floods characteristics \citep{Keller2019a}. A physically-based model was also needed for the analysis of \citet{Paschalis2014} with TOPKAPI-ETH on the interplay of rainfall's temporal variability and the clustering of saturated areas in flood generation.

Work on droughts is much less abundant in Switzerland than work on floods, which is related to the fact that missing water was, in the past, not a hot topic in this country known as the water tower of Europe \citep{Milano2015}. What can be highlighted here is that the same models are in use to assess droughts and floods, potentially with specific recalibration, but without modification of the model structure. This is motivated by the fact that existing models are deemed to reproduce well all dominant processes in the Swiss environment, as, e.g., explicitly stated in the work of \citet{Zappa2007a} on quantifying the hydrological impact of the 2003 heatwave with a distributed version of PREVAH. It was also later on used for additional drought analyses \citep{Brunner2019e, Zappa2019}, where a spatial mismatch between water scarcity and storage availability has been highlighted for Switzerland \citep{Brunner2019e}. Similarly, HBV-light served in several drought studies, such as for the definition of a new drought index that accounts for snow \citep{Staudinger2014}, the predictability of low flows \citep{Staudinger2014a}, or the sensitivity of catchments to meteorological droughts \citep{Staudinger2015}. It was also used to assess low flow drivers in Alpine catchments \citep{Arnoux2020}. However, significant efforts to improve the model representation of groundwater and the corresponding baseflow during droughts remain to be done in Switzerland, which might lead to further model diversification.


\subsubsection{Climate change impact analysis}
\label{sec:context:climatechange}

Climate change impact studies emerged in Switzerland in the 1990s, including a large national research programme on climate change and natural hazards \citep{SNFS2021}. Since then, all model-based studies are mostly conducted with the models that established themselves in Switzerland, which have, however, not been specifically designed for climate change impact analysis; detailed assessments of how well these models can simulate future conditions are largely missing. Climate change impact analyses require, among others, a good representation of the processes that play a key role in the studies. The representation of these processes in the models is discussed in Sect. \ref{sec:context:processes}, both for present and future climate conditions. These studies also require models that are not too time-consuming due to processing of long transient periods as well as due to the increasing ensemble size of modelling chains.

WaSiM was chosen by \citet{Middelkoop2001} for a climate change impact study primarily due to its good interpolation of meteorological data for mountain environments, and by \citet{Jasper2004} to assess the effect of different regional climate scenarios in the Thur and the Ticino catchments (Fig. 1). WaSiM has also been applied to assess future soil water patterns \citep{Jasper2006, Rossler2012} and future summer evapotranspiration regimes \citep{Calanca2006}, applications where a more physically-based representation of vertical and horizontal flow processes -- involving the Richards equation -- is important. It was even applied for the entire Rhine basin at a 1~km\textsuperscript{2} resolution down to Rotterdam by \citet{Kleinn2005}.

TOPKAPI-ETH, the other frequently used physically-based distributed model, has also been applied to several climate change impact studies, such as in the analysis of internal climate variability \citep{Fatichi2014}, or the assessment of future water resources \citep{Finger2012}. It was also selected by \citet{Fatichi2015}, who argues that "it represents a reasonable compromise between physically meaningful representation of hydrological processes and computational time for large-scale ($>$1000~km\textsuperscript{2}), long-term ($>$20~yr), high-resolution ($<$1~km\textsuperscript{2}) distributed simulations".

However, the most widely used models to study climate change impact on streamflow are to date the reservoir-based models PREVAH (\citealt{Koplin2012, Speich2015, Milano2015a, Brunner2019c} and others;  see Supplementary material) and HBV-light (\citealt{Etter2017, Hakala2020, Brunner2018a, Jenicek2018}  and others). In the western part of Switzerland, RS MINERVE and GSM-SOCONT have been used, especially for high elevation sites \citep{Horton2006, Uhlmann2013a, Uhlmann2013b, Terrier2015}. The rationale for using these models is well summarized by \citet{Koplin2010} who, for PREVAH, states that the model ``has been developed especially to suit conditions in mountainous environments'' and that it ``has proved to be a reliable and flexible tool for various scopes of application and climate conditions ranging from drought analysis over water balance modelling to flood estimation and forecasting''. 

One point to note is that the adequacy of the models to a different climate is generally not discussed. References to previous studies are sometimes provided, without the latter having addressed this point explicitly. While it is relatively easy to demonstrate a model's ability to reproduce floods or drought conditions, its transferability to other climate conditions is more difficult to prove directly, and generally not tackled, as we discuss later on ( see Sect. \ref{sec:multi-model}). 

\subsubsection{Operational forecasting}
\label{sec:context:forecasting}

The ever increasing need for reliable real-time streamflow forecasts leads to a continuous evolution of the underlying hydro-meteorological modelling systems. Operational forecasting started with deterministic forecasts from a single meteorological forecast applied to a single hydrological model; today, users expect full probabilistic ensemble forecasts at hourly time scales, updated every few hours and with several meteorological inputs applied to different hydrological models \citep{Jasper2016}. Coupled atmospheric--hydrologic ensemble prediction systems were proven to provide better forecasts than deterministic simulations \citep{Verbunt2007, Zappa2008, Jaun2008, Liechti2013}. These might also include data assimilation schemes \citep{JorgHess2015a} or the assessment of hydrologic uncertainty related to meteorological forcing, model parameters and initial conditions \citep{Jaun2009, Zappa2011a, Fundel2011}.

Such modern forecasting systems require hydrological models that provide forecasts at many locations in a stream network, and that includes the effect of hydraulic infrastructures (e.g., of hydropower water intakes and accumulation lakes, see Sect. \ref{sec:context:infrastructures}). Since the early times of flood forecasting in Switzerland, HBV and PREVAH were used in governmental offices \citep{Jasper2016} as well as in research institutes because of their relative simplicity and low computational costs \citep{Verbunt2006, Addor2011, Murphy2019, Antonetti2019}. Along with HBV, PREVAH and LARSIM, WaSiM is today part of the Swiss operational ensemble forecasting system \citep{Jasper2016}, which uses the FEWS platform (Flood Early Warning System; \citealp{Werner2013}) to provide forecasts for the cantonal authorities and the public \citep{FOEN2019}. A key advantage of the WaSiM model is that it can explicitly account for lake regulations and hydropower operations (J. Schulla, personal communication, October 23, 2020). WaSiM has also been used for research studies on improving operational flood forecasting in mountainous areas \citep{Jasper2002, Jasper2003, Ahrens2003a, Ahrens2003b}.

In parallel to the models mentioned above, RS MINERVE is being used as a specific flood forecasting tool for the upper Rhone river catchment, a large catchment (5220 km\textsuperscript{2}, see Fig. \ref{fig:map}) strongly influenced by glacier melt and hydropower production \citep{GarciaHernandez2009b, GarciaHernandez2009, Jordan2010}. The model has been primarily developed for this application. Furthermore, its interpolation of the meteorological forcing and its partitioning between rain and snowfall have been enhanced to improve the forecasts in this catchment \citep{Tobin2011, Tobin2012}.

Applications or studies of subseasonal to seasonal (lead times up to 4 to 6 weeks) streamflow forecasts are relatively scarce in Switzerland, but few applications using PREVAH exist \citep[][]{Monhart2019, Anghileri2019}. PREVAH also plays a prominent role in operational drought forecasting \citep{Fundel2013, JorgHess2015, Bogner2018b} and within the operational Swiss drought information platform (\citealp{Stahli2013}). 


\subsubsection{Large scale modelling}
\label{sec:context:largescale}

To complete the picture, we address here the application of some international hydrological models implemented for Europe or large European river basins such as the Rhine and thus covering at least a significant part of the hydrological domain of Switzerland (Fig. \ref{fig:map}). However, we restrict ourselves to those models whose code is publicly available and/or whose results are published and/or directly available for Swiss basins.

\citet{Kauffeldt2016} presented a technical review of large-scale hydrological models with regard to their suitability for the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). Specific criteria must be met for a model to be suitable for continental-scale forecasting, such as a representation of all major processes in the domain, flexibility in resolution and spatial discretisation, a possibility for data assimilation, etc. \citep{Kauffeldt2016}. Amongst the models evaluated in the study, three have been specifically deployed for Europe: LISFLOOD, HYPE and mHM (see Appendix 1). While LISFLOOD and HYPE (or E-HYPE for the version covering the pan-European continent) are already running operationally (see Appendix 1) at the European scale, mHM has only recently been applied for the development and evaluation of a pan-European multi-model seasonal hydrological forecasting system \citep{Wanders2019}.

Several other models have been applied specifically for the Rhine basin, mainly focusing on forecasting discharge or climate change impact applications. Examples include the so-called wflow\_hbv model (\citealp{vanOsnabrugge2017}, \citealp{vanOsnabrugge2019} and \citealt{vanOsnabrugge2020}) for hourly/daily streamflow forecasting of the Rhine, allowing lake level data assimilation. Another example is the LARSIM model, which was implemented at a 1~km\textsuperscript{2} resolution in combination with HBV-light to assess the origin of streamflow components \citep{Stahl2017}. The major regulated and unregulated lakes were included in LARSIM, as well as four of the most influent ``clustered'' hydropower reservoirs present on the upper Aare, upper Reuss, upper Rhine, and in the Ill river catchment (Fig. \ref{fig:map}).

In general, the skill of most large scale models is found to be inferior near the main Alpine ridge compared to mountainous or lowland areas. The high Alpine catchments have been identified early as posing a major challenge to large scale hydrological modelling \citep{Kleinn2005}.  Besides larger errors in the meteorological variables (precipitation in particular) and the important effect of water management practices, the smaller the catchment area and the greater the elevation ranges, the more detailed the model structure and the spatial resolution need to be to achieve good model performances \citep{Gurtz2003}. While most likely being cancelled out downstream \citep{Kleinn2005}, these problems remain yet to be addressed in large scale modelling and certainly partly explain why specific Swiss-scale models continue to be extremely popular. 


\section{The motivations behind the model's choice}
\label{sec:motivations}

In total, we reviewed 157 peer-reviewed journal articles on hydrological modelling in Swiss catchments (see Table 1 in the Supporting Information). Excluding the large scale applications (Section \ref{sec:context:largescale}), a Swiss hydrological model (category D or E in Table 1) is selected in 93\% of cases, leaving little room for international models. PREVAH takes the lion's share with about 30\% of the applications, followed by HBV-light (16.5\%) and WaSiM (14.6\%). The most used international model is SWAT with a small 4\% usage (7 cases), mainly related to research led from outside Switzerland.

As depicted in Sect. \ref{sec:context}, some models are specialised for certain processes, such as ALPINE3D for snow and GERM for glaciers, and are thus proportionally more used in these contexts (Fig. \ref{fig:applications}). TOPKAPI-ETH tends to be more used for processes that need a physically-based representation or that need a gridded spatial structure to provide gridded output, e.g. in view of coupling to another model. RS specifically targets flood modelling and hydropower operations, as it was designed for operational flood mitigation with hydropower plants. The three most used models, i.e. PREVAH, HBV-light and WaSiM, are general models and are applied to different topics, such as climate change impact studies, floods, droughts, cryosphere-related processes, and operational forecasting (Fig. \ref{fig:applications}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.70\columnwidth]{figures/chord_diagram_contexts}
		\caption{{Hydrological models applied to different contexts in Switzerland. The importance of the link is proportional to the number of scientific articles. The importance of some models can be inflated by the fact that an article can address multiple contexts, such as floods and climate change. Models with too few use cases (less than three) are not included for the sake of clarity. A3D stands for ALPINE3D and G-SCNT for GSM-SOCONT.

\end{figure}

In the articles analysed, about 25\% of the authors specifically address the model's adequacy with the context or the landscape. However, this does not mean that adequacy has been formally tested or that it actually drove the choice of the model, but rather that it is argued as suitable to the intended application. About 53\% of the articles do not provide any mention of adequacy. The rest provide some description of the model characteristics that might be interpreted as arguments for suitability to the case study. Furthermore, there are only few examples where the perceptual model, i.e. the modellers' perception of how nature works, is explicitly discussed, a shortcoming that is the rule rather than the exception in hydrological modelling works \citep{Beven2021}.

If adequacy can drive the model choice, other factors come into play, some of a practical nature and others of a more subjective nature. \citet{Addor2019} argue that the choice of a model is driven by legacy rather than adequacy, where by legacy they understand: ``practicality, convenience, experience, and habit''. This can include, on the one hand, the experience available in the modelling group and, on the other hand, code and data availability. Some of these aspects are not reflected in the literature -- as peer-reviewed articles involve a reshaping of the narration \citep{Pontille2007, Rinck2010, Babel2019} -- and are therefore difficult to assess objectively without additional information. For that reason, a survey was conducted, and all first authors of the papers analysed were invited to participate, as well as other actors in the research community actively using hydrological modelling approaches in Switzerland. About 100 persons were contacted, and 50 took part in the survey.

The survey, which could be filled anonymously, consisted first in general questions on the experience of the researcher in the domain of hydrological modelling and model development (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_general}). The objective of this first part is to provide a context to the answers given in the rest of the survey. Then, multiple-choice questions (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}) addressed the choice of the hydrological model for previous work (14 questions), the factors that the researcher would nowadays consider important in model selection (nine questions), and finally, the researcher opinion on multi-modelling approaches (four questions; treated at Sect. \ref{sec:multi-model}). The answers in Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms} have been stratified based on the involvement of the researcher in model development (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_general}d). Other stratifications have been performed (not shown) but were less discriminant than the one selected.

\end{figure}


About half (52.5\%) of the researchers published -- as first author -- work done mainly at a single institute (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_general}b). The selection of the model that is developed and used at the research institute is supposedly a strong driver \citep{Addor2019}. We could indeed observe that the first author is affiliated with the institute where the model is being developed for 66\% of the articles analysed. When asked if the model developed at the institute was selected without further comparison, the researcher's opinions differed (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}), with no strong signal. While 36.2\% seemed to agree with that statement, 44.7\% did not agree, including both non-developers and researchers mostly involved in model development. Researchers with less development experience were also more influenced by their superior when it came to model selection. However, in general, know-how at the institute was considered a relevant driver by 72\% of the researchers (67.4\% for the present situation), significantly more than the personal knowledge of a model (which, however, seems much more important for the present situation). The strong link between the institutes and some models is also supported by Fig. \ref{fig:model-institutes}. The model at hand is thus well known, the code is available, and specialists are present to make necessary adaptations to it. It can be considered as a positive aspect as modelling habits can contribute to efficiency and expertise \citep{Babel2019}, as long as it is not at the expense of adequacy. The risk of habits lies in the automatism of our decisions \citep{Babel2019}, and in the Hammer and Nail syndrome ("if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"), i.e. a researcher will seek to solve every problem with the known model \citep{Hamalainen2015}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.70\columnwidth]{figures/chord_diagram_institutes}
		\caption{{Links between hydrological models and the Swiss institutes that use them. Same conventions as Fig. \ref{fig:applications}. Models or institutes with too few use cases are not included.
		{\label{fig:model-institutes}}
		}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

When the model is not from the institute, collaborations are often established with the developer or the lead researcher of the model, leading to the fact that for 72\% of the articles, the model developer (or team leader) is co-authoring the paper. The survey results show that collaboration was a driving factor for 50\% of the researchers (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}). Another reason driving the choice for one hydrological model is the reuse of a model already set up for a catchment of interest, sometimes without the need to recalibrate it. About 20\% of the articles explicitly state that the applied model comes from another study. Likely, this number should be higher as some authors publish multiple articles targeting different topics but on one model setup, without explicitly mentioning it. The survey revealed that 51\% of the researchers agreed that model setups had been reused (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}).

Access to the model source code has been qualified as a relevant driving factor by 55.1\% of the researchers for previous work, unsurprisingly with a clear contribution from model developers (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}). This number even increases to a strong 81.6\% for nowadays situation, which reveals a strong desire to be able to edit the model code to adapt it when necessary. Modifications are sometimes done, but it might also partly be a psychological factor, i.e. people feel more secure to invest time and energy in a model that they know they can eventually adapt if necessary, rather than being stuck in a situation where they cannot implement something that they might need. However, if access to the model code is important to many, it does not mean that everyone sees the public availability (as open-source) of the model code as necessary. Indeed, 61.2\% of the researchers agreed with that statement, which is high, but less than for the individual access to the code. Some models have been open-source for a long time, such as VIC or FUSE, but either were used very sporadically for an individual catchment -generally by foreign institutions- or haven't yet been used in Switzerland.

Adequacy to specific processes or landscapes was considered as important in model selection by 57.1\% of the researchers for past studies and by 65.3\% for the present situation (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}). Ease of use does not seem to have had a substantial impact on model selection in the past but would be more important today. Technical constraints, data availability, and project-related constraints had an impact, although they do not seem to often be the leading factor. Today's opinions differ about considering as important the widespread usage of a model or the existence of a strong community of developers behind it. 

As for external influences, education seems to play only a marginal role, but sociological aspects, such as recommendations from colleagues or peers, had a non-negligible impact (38.8\%), mainly for researchers not involved in model development. \citet{Babel2019} show, based on interviews with model developers, that different actors play an indirect role in the choices made during the conception of a model as transferred knowledge becomes self-evident for the modeler. This process of incorporation of external influences is also likely to happen in model selection. Finally, emotions are not stated as a key factor, mainly for past work. We would have expected a stronger signal of personal attachment of the developers to their model. This dimension is highly subjective, and we dare to suggest that this subconscious driver is more important than stated on the survey answers, mainly for developers invested in a specific model. Indeed, \citet{Chamberlin1890} shows that people tend to develop a parental affection for their theories, which can be transposed to models, and which hinders recognition of the benefits of other approaches. Moreover, emotions were shown to play a significant role in decision making and can be seen as "invisible actors in the system of problem solving" \citep{Hamalainen2015}. Additional factors were given, such as computational time or handling of multiple spatial scales across variable geophysical properties.


\section{On model structural uncertainty and multi-model approaches}
\label{sec:multi-model}

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) used to carry out comparisons of hydrological models and publish the results in Operational hydrology reports. Different international models were compared over various catchments, including the Dischma basin in Switzerland. The Snowmelt Runoff Model \citep[SRM,][see supplementary material]{Martinec1975} has also been assessed in these early model comparisons \citep{WMO1986, WMO1992a}.

Since then, there are only few model intercomparison studies in Switzerland. The existing ones are studies on what we can gain from model complexity in terms of model performance. For example, \citet{Gurtz2003} compared PREVAH and WaSiM for two mountainous catchments, showing that both models perform with similar statistical efficiency. Similarly, \citet{Orth2015} compared HBV-light, PREVAH, and a simpler model, finding in like manner that added complexity does not necessarily lead to improved performance and that this can vary greatly depending on the considered hydrological variable (e.g., runoff vs soil moisture) or hydrological conditions (floods vs droughts). 

Similarly, few studies are relying on a multi-model approach. The use of multiple hydrological models aims at accounting for the uncertainty associated with the models' structure, their numerical implementation, and their processes representation. The idea is to not seek a single model displaying the best performance regarding observations, but to consider a diversity of models that represent the uncertainty at play in modelling approaches \citep{Babel2019}. The use of a multi-model framework was also proven relevant in the context of probabilistic flood forecasting \citep{Kauffeldt2016}. For example, Kobierska et al. (\citeyear{Kobierska2011, Kobierska2013}) used both ALPINE3D and PREVAH for the assessment of future runoff from a mountain catchment with a glacier contribution, and \citet{Andrianaki2019} added SWAT for the same setting. A different description of some underlying processes resulted in seasonal variability of model performance and in different findings, highlighting that results of climate change studies in glacierized basins can also strongly depend on the sensitivity of the model's parameters. 

Quantification of uncertainty sources in climate impact studies has been assessed by \citet{Bosshard2013a} for the Alpine Rhine using PREVAH and HBV. None of the assessed uncertainty sources was found negligible. The model's impact was more important in winter and spring than in summer or autumn, where the climate models have a larger contribution. \citet{Addor2014} also assessed the impact of climate change on hydrological regimes with the consideration of multiple sources of uncertainties, including the hydrological model. They applied HBV-light, PREVAH, and WaSiM to six catchments in Switzerland and identified that the contribution of the hydrological models to the uncertainty was significant in (partially) glacierized catchments. This finding is in agreement with the recent re-evaluation of climate change impact on Swiss hydrology Hydro-CH2018 \citep{FOEN2021}. In this study  HBV-light and two different versions of PREVAH (one raster based \citep{Speich2015}  and one HRU based \citep{Viviroli2009a}) have been applied independently to CH2018 climate scenarios, in three different institutes. For the catchments simulated in common, the largest percentage variations between the models occur specially in highly glaciated or high-elevation catchments in the low flow seasons winter and spring. The greatest absolute differences in discharge between the models occur in summer, in glaciated regions.

It was assumed that the parameters calibrated for the present conditions also apply in the future. As shown by \citep{Melsen2021}, this is an important and specific uncertainty factor in the modelling approach. They ran three frequently used hydrological models (SAC, VIC, and HBV) for historical and future periods, and explored parameter sensitivity changes across 605 catchments in the United States. While among all hydrological models the sensitivity of snow parameters consistently decreases in the future, which other parameters increase in sensitivity is less clear. In more than 40\% of the catchments, dependent on the hydrological model, at least one parameter changes in the future in the 5 most sensitive parameters \citep{Melsen2021}. While this goes in hand with the need to adapt calibration strategies for future projections, the disagreement among the models on the processes that become more relevant in the future also calls for a strict evaluation of the adequacy of the model structure for long-term simulations \citep{Melsen2021}.

In fact, the survey revealed that 80\% of the researchers considered the impact of the model structure as an important source of uncertainty, and 72\% supported that multi-models should be considered (Fig. \ref{fig:survey_histograms}). However, only about 20\% claimed to do it regularly, while 53\% admitted to (almost) never do it. The first reason given for not doing multi-model approaches is the lack of resources (time or/and money) for such exercise (supported by 76.6\% of the participants). The second reason is that it requires too much effort to set up another model (61.7\% of the participants); the third one is that other sources of uncertainty are considered more significant (40.4\%), and the fourth is related to the lack of know-how of another hydrological model (31.9\%). In addition, other reasons were provided, such as the carbon footprint of simulations and thus the need to do as few simulations as possible with improved models or the difficulty to interpret the results. Other participants suggested working with a single model but testing multiple structures and parameter values or working with model variants.

The articles published by a given researcher involve the same hydrological model 70\% of the time, two models 18\% of the time, and more rarely multiple independent models (8\%; Fig. \ref{fig:survey_general}). As discussed above, the use of another hydrological model requires a substantial effort. An eased assessment of multiple structures is the objective of the so-called "modular frameworks" (used only 4\% of the time by the survey participants), strongly encouraged by \citet{Clark2011a}. Nowadays, different flexible frameworks exist, such as SUPERFLEX, FUSE \citep{Clark2008}, PERSiST \citep{Futter2014}, ECHSE \citep{Kneis2015}, MARRMoT \citep{Knoben2019}, Raven \citep{Craig2020}, and SUMMA \citep{Clark2015}. Hydrologic process analysis might require model structural changes to allow new hypotheses to be tested. An example is given by \citet{DalMolin2020}, who discusses, based on the SUPERFLEX framework, how to flexibly adapt the model structure to integrate new hypotheses about dominant hydrological processes. 

In the survey, researchers were neutral (38.3\%) to positive (49\%) about using modular frameworks to tackle the issue of model structural uncertainty (however, the terms being not familiar to all, some users did not understand the question). A participant noted that on the one hand, modular frameworks can enable running different model conceptualisations in parallel with the technical know-how to deal with one framework, but on the other hand, they can have their own biases, such as the numerical implementation or the spatial discretisation. Other participants preferred testing several variants of the meteorological forcing and a better model evaluation to the use of modular modelling frameworks.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Focusing on Switzerland, we carried out a comprehensive literature review on the hydrological models developed and applied in different contexts. The objective of this work was to disentangle the motivations and reasons behind the choices that led to the current co-existence of a wide range of streamflow models in a small country. To structure the analysis, we attempted a classification into process-driven and application-driven influences. For all reviewed studies, we examined the arguments that were explicitly put forward by the authors for model selection, as well as implicit aspects, such as the author's affiliation or co-authorships. Additionally, a survey was conducted among the authors and other actors in hydrological modelling in Switzerland to better assess more subjective drivers.

The model adequacy for the study context or the landscape is explicitly addressed by only 25\% of the articles, while 53\% make no mention of adequacy, neither provide any justification for the choice of the model. The models that have specifically been developed to represent specific processes, such as snow- or glacier melt or hydropower operations, are obviously mainly used in these contexts. However, the more general models, which are also the most used ones, are applied indifferently to various contexts and landscapes.

Not surprisingly, researchers active in Switzerland are very keen on using a model developed in Switzerland (93\% of the case studies) or even at their own research institute (66\% of the articles analysed), and possibly used on the same catchment previously (20\%). Moreover, this is likely to be the cause of the existence of so many hydrological models, as each research group develops its own tools.


While we see an impressive model diversity at the single or few catchments scale, it is noteworthy that our review points towards an important national-scale shortcoming: while there are catchments that have been ``over-modelled'' (e.g. Thur, Dischma) - however with little model intercomparison (see Sect. \ref{sec:multi-model}) - there is a clear lack of large scale or national studies. In particular, the few available studies often do not cross the Swiss national border, even though the ``hydrological Switzerland'' extends to its neighbouring countries (Fig. \ref{fig:map}). The absence of such larger-scale studies might be explained by shortcomings and challenges more widely encountered in hydrological modelling over larger domains. These include differing quality and scales of input data and streamflow observations and large heterogeneity in hydrological behaviour (possibly requiring more than one specialised model). Yet, this heterogeneity may in fact provide us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of differences in model adequacy and model performance and to draw most needed conclusions on the robustness of generalisations and on estimation uncertainty \citep{Gupta2014,McMillan2016}.

With ongoing climate change and ensuing impacts for water resources and water-related hazard management, hydrological modelling might need to adapt to new challenges. In Alpine environments, the most striking example is certainly the emergence of hydrological droughts \citep{VanLoon2015} during summer and fall \citep{Brunner2019e, Rigling2020}, which requires understanding the drivers of low flow \citep{Arnoux2020} and the development of hydrological models that reliably represent groundwater recharge. This component is, in fact, crudely parametrised in many streamflow models for alpine environments. Furthermore, improved modelling of surface water-groundwater interactions is also a pre-condition for water temperature projections, agricultural water use and related water quality, drinking water management, and biodiversity assessment in ecosystems strongly influenced by river-groundwater interactions \citep{Brunner2017}. Another key topic that is likely to receive growing attention is the role of the vegetation in modulating climate extremes \citep{Mastrotheodoros2020} and land-use changes induced by climate warming, calling thereby for improved representations of vegetation's role in hydrological models.

Accordingly, application-oriented and research-oriented models will see further development in the near future that can lead to diversification. Indeed, there cannot be a single model valid for all applications \citep{Hamalainen2015}, and a diversity of models is interesting to represent the uncertainty related to the model structure or implementation \citep{Babel2019}. However, there should be more multi-model applications to harness this diversity instead of neglecting it. A first barrier to this approach is the challenge to master multiple models. In this regard, modular frameworks can help to move in this direction, but they also have their own limitations. Another approach lies in collaborations between institutes. However, the second barrier emphasised by the survey is lack of resources (time and/or money). This could be a point that we should emphasise more in the search for funds and raise awareness of the funding agencies.

It is also likely that more international models will be adopted in Switzerland for two reasons. The first is to account for processes that most Swiss models have not specialised in, such as agricultural water use, ecosystem interactions, and water quality. The second reason is the growing adoption of version control systems that allow collaboration on open-source code with unprecedented ease. Indeed, as the survey revealed, most researchers desire access to the source code to have the ability to adapt it to their needs. Thus, when a project cannot be achieved with the in-house model, open-source models offer an interesting alternative. Hopefully, it should increase contributions to model improvements and benefit a community-driven dynamic that would benefit all, increasing thereby international collaborations.

ADD Intro Paragraph from rebuttal

\textbf{ALPINE3D} \citep{Lehning2006} is a model developed in Switzerland targeting surface processes in alpine environments, in particular snow processes, and is suitable for very steep terrain. It targets applications where the small-scale variability at the atmosphere-surface interface is important. Three-dimensional aspects relate to processes in the atmosphere, such as drifting snow. The snow-related processes are modelled by the physically-based SNOWPACK model (\citealt{Bartelt2002, Lehning2002a, Lehning2002b}). ALPINE3D has a built-in runoff module adapted from an early version of PREVAH \citep{Lehning2006} and a runoff module that solves the Richards equations \citep{Wever2017}. It has been recently extended by a hydrological simulation tool for streamflow and water temperature prediction; this extended version is called StreamFlow (see there) \citep{Gallice2016}. ALPINE3D it is coded in C++ and freely available at https://models.slf.ch/.  

\textbf{CemaNeige-GR6J} is the daily version of a lumped, bucket-type rainfall-runoff model with six free parameters \citep{Pushpalatha2011}, combined with the CemaNeige snow module \citep{Valery2014a, Valery2014b}, which is a routine for snow accumulation and melt based on a degree-day concept that introduces two additional free parameters. GR6J is an empirical model with a root zone storage and two routing routines: one for the slow (unit hydrograph) and one for the fast flow component ({unit hydrograph}, a non-linear and an exponential store). Both flow components interact with the groundwater through an exchange coefficient. It has seen one application in Switzerland for a climate change impact study \citep{Keller2019a}. An R-implementation of CemaNeige-GRJ is available via https://rdrr.io/cran/airGR/.

\textbf{DECIPHeR} (Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology; \citealp{Coxon2019}) is an open-source flexible model framework suited for different spatial scales. The model builds on the code and key concepts of Dynamic TOPMODEL (\citealp{Beven2001}), an improvement of the original TOPMODEL (TOPography based hydrological model; \citealp{Beven1979}). It can be run as a lumped model (1 HRU), as semi-distributed (multiple HRUs) or as fully distributed (HRU for every single grid cell). Each HRU is treated as a separate functional unit in the model and thus allows for different process conceptualisations and parameterisations across the catchment. The model is open-source (https://github.com/uob-hydrology/DECIPHeR).

\textbf{GERM} (Glacier Evolution Runoff Model; \citealt{Huss2016, Farinotti2012}) consists of five different modules, which largely rely on existing approaches, dealing with snow accumulation, ablation, glacier evolution, evapotranspiration and runoff routing. It is a fully distributed, deterministic, conceptual model designed mainly for simulations at a daily resolution and a high spatial resolution. Glacier geometry is updated annually according to a non-parametric approach proposed by \citet{Huss2010}. The hydrological module is based on the concept of linear reservoirs and distinguishes five surface types: ice, snow, rock, vegetation and open water. 

\textbf{GSM-SOCONT} (Glacier and SnowMelt -- SOil CONTribution model; \citealp{Schaefli2005c}) is a semi-lumped conceptual glacio-hydrological model composed of the reservoir-based SOCONT model (consisting in a linear reservoir for the slow soil contribution and a non-linear reservoir for direct runoff) and the GSM model for the glacierized area. The SOCONT model was inspired by the GR3 model \citep{Edijatno1989}, which is part of the GR model family as is CemaNeige-GR6J (see above). It was developed at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and is implemented in RS (see below). A version of GSM-SOCONT is distributed via www.mathworks.com.

\textbf{HBV} (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning model; \citealp{Bergstrom1976a, Bergstrom1992, Bergstrom1995, Lindstrm1997})  is a rainfall-runoff model that focuses on runoff generation processes, including snow. The model is characterised, by its original developers \citep{Bergstrom1992}, as being very general and is thus applied in many different geographical and climatological conditions. The HBV model can today be considered as a general modelling concept that, besides in the official version developed by SMHI, has been implemented in many different software (see an example below).  

\textbf{HBV-light} \citep{Seibert2012} is a software implementation of the HBV model (see above) that is further developed at the University of Zurich. HBV-light corresponds to a simplified and user-friendly version of the original model. 

\textbf{HYPE} (HYdrological Predictions for the Environment, \citealp{Lindstrom2010}) is a large-scale semi-distributed conceptual model, designed to simulate discharge and model flow paths of nutrients in the water cycle. It was originally developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute and is open-source. The model divides the landscape into classes according to the soil type, land use and altitude, and the parameters are either global or coupled to the soil type or land-use. The model can simulate natural hydrological processes of snow- and glacier melt, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, groundwater and routing through rivers and lakes, but also human-induced influences, such as regulated lakes and reservoirs, water abstractions and irrigation. HYPE is run operationally by SMHI for several purposes (e.g. flood forecasting or climate change impact assessments). The version covering the pan-European continent is referred to as E-HYPE, its application is entirely based on open and readily available data sources \citep{Donnelly2015}, including historical data (1981-2010), 1-10 day forecast, seasonal forecasts, climate change impact scenarios and actual model performance (\url{https://hypeweb.smhi.se/explore-water/geographical-domains/\#europehype}).

\textbf{LARSIM} (Large Area Runoff Simulation Model; \citealp{Ludwig2006}) is a semi-distributed hydrological model, which describes continuous runoff processes in catchments and river network. It is a non-commercial software that, albeit not being open-source, has a well-established European developer community (https://www.larsim.info/). The model structure (subunit) can be grid-based or based on hydrologic subcatchments. While runoff generation (described with parallel linear storage reservoirs), routing (depending on channel geometries and roughness conditions) and flow retention are simulated at the subunit scale, snow storage, evapotranspiration, interception and soil storage are simulated at a subscale level according to land use classes. While it doesn't include a glacier melt component, LARSIM includes many features that were specifically designed for its operational use as a flood forecasting model, as well as offline applications \citep{Stahl2017}. 

\textbf{LISFLOOD} is a freely available, GIS-based model for catchment-scale water balance simulation \citep{vanDerKniff2010} (https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/). It has been specifically designed for large river catchments, and in particular, it makes use of data layers that are available for the Joint Research Center (JRC) at European scale, such as land use, soil type and texture, river network \citep{Thielen2009}. LISFLOOD is used by the European Flood Awareness System, EFAS, for medium- and seasonal-range forecasts with a 6-hourly and daily time step. Both historical river discharge time series (1991 to near real-time) and reforecasts (1999-2018) are available on the Climate Data Store of Copernicus (\url{https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/}). 

\textbf{mHM} (mesoscale Hydrological model; \citealt{Samaniego2010a, Kumar2013, Thober2019}) is a distributed hydrological model, which has the particularity of using the multiscale parameter regionalization approach (MPR, \citealp{Samaniego2010a}) for parameter identification. It has been specifically developed to not need recalibration when applied at different resolutions \citep{Kauffeldt2016}. It is driven by hourly or daily meteorological forcings and utilises observable basin physical characteristics to infer the spatial variability of the required parameters. It is developed by the Umweltforschungszentrum Leipzig and has been successfully applied to catchments ranging from 4 km\textsuperscript{2} and to beyond 500,000 km\textsuperscript{2}. To the best of our knowledge, it does not yet have a glacier melt component. The open-source code (Fortran) is available at \url{https://git.ufz.de}.

\textbf{PREVAH} (Precipitation-Runoff-Evapotranspiration HRU Model; \citealt{Gurtz1999, Viviroli2009a}) is a Swiss conceptual model that has been developed specifically for heterogeneous mountainous environments with highly spatially and temporally variable processes. It follows the HBV model structure, with numerous modifications, and was designed for studies in Alpine headwater basins \citep{Orth2015}. PREVAH branched out into different versions, two of which are mostly used: an HRU-based version on an hourly time step \citep{Viviroli2009a} and a fully distributed version on a daily time step \citep{Zappa2012, Speich2015}. If not stated otherwise, this paper refers to the distributed version. There is currently no freely available version.

\textbf{RS} (Routing System; \citealp{Dubois2000, GarciaHernandez2020, Foehn2020}) is a modelling system that has been developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). The freely available version is called RS MINERVE; it was developed for operational flood forecasting in Valais \citep{GarciaHernandez2009b,Hamdi2005} and is maintained by the CREALP (Centre de recherche sur l'environnement alpin). RS uses the hydrological model GSM-SOCONT and couples it to an explicit modelling of water routing, including hydraulic and hydropower infrastructure.

\textbf{SEHR-ECHO} (Spatially Explicit Hydrologic Response model for ecohydrologic applications; \citealp{Schaefli2014}) is an evolution of GSM-SOCONT that was developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). The model aims at taking into account the spatial variability in the runoff generation. The catchment is divided into subcatchments connected to the river network in order to account for the origin of the different areal contributions and to route them in the river network. A Matlab implementation is distributed via www.mathworks.com.

\textbf{StreamFlow} is an extension of ALPINE3D (see above). It sums the output of Alpine3D at sub-catchment scale, determines a residence time using two linear reservoirs in series \citep{Comola2015} and then either computes instant routing or based on the Muskingum-Cunge approach as does SEHR-ECHO (see above). All details of the model are presented in the work of Gallice et al. (2016). The model is coded in C++ and is freely available on https://models.slf.ch/

\textbf{SUPERFLEX} \citep{Fenicia2011a, Kavetski2011} is a flexible hydrological framework now developed at Eawag (the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology). It allows building hydrological models using generic components for hypothesis testing. The building blocks are reservoirs, lag functions, and connections. The models elaborated with SUPERFLEX can be lumped, semi-distributed \citep{Fenicia2016} or fully distributed \citep{Hostache2020}. An open-source version written in Python, SuperflexPy, is currently available \citet{DalMolin2020a}.

\textbf{SWAT} (Soil Water and Assessment Tool; \citealp{Arnold1998}) is an freely available semi-distributed, process-based hydrological modelling software (https://swat.tamu.edu/). Besides hydrology, other SWAT components can simulate energy balance, soil temperature, mass transport and land management at the sub-basin and HRU levels. It is one of the most applied models worldwide probably because of the broad range of hydrologic and environmental problems that can be addressed with it. A completely revised version, SWAT+ (https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/), providing more flexible spatial representations, was released in 2021, applications in Switzerland are still to come. Recent work cited in this paper is mostly based on SWAT 2012.

\textbf{TOPKAPI-ETH} \citep{Finger2011, Ragettli2012}, developed at ETH Zurich, is a branch of the TOPKAPI model (TOPographic Kinematic APproximation and Integration; \citealp{Todini1995, Todini2002, Liu2002, Ciarapica2002}).  It is a fully distributed and physically-based model based on the spatial integration  of the kinematic wave model over the pixels of the digital elevation model (DEM). TOPKAPI-ETH has been modified for application to mountain basins by adding a second soil layer and modules for snow, glaciers, reservoirs, water abstraction, and diversion, and a new evapotranspiration scheme \citep{Finger2011, Finger2012, Fatichi2015}. 

\textbf{VIC} (Variable Infiltration Capacity model; \citealp{Liang1994a}) is an open-source grid-based land surface hydrological modelling software whose official version is currently developed in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. (https://vic.readthedocs.io/). It is implemented so that grid cells with a resolution up to 1km are simulated independently of each other. Sub-grid heterogeneity introduced by different land-use types and elevation is handled via statistical distributions. Routing must be performed separately with an additional routine taking care of the water transport between cells.

\textbf{WaSiM} (Water Flow and Balance Simulation Model; \citealp{Schulla2007, Schulla2009}) is a fully distributed hydrological modelling system (including several sub-versions) originally developed at ETH Zurich  and now further developed by a private company (http://www.wasim.ch/), for use in research, administration and engineering companies. The model describes the water fluxes in the unsaturated soil using the 1D-Richards equation \citep{Richards1931}. The transfer function (runoff concentration) can be processed through a series of linear reservoirs or with the kinematic wave approach (from one cell to another). WaSiM covers a wide range of hydrological processes relevant for alpine environments, with different implemented variants. The original model was developed under the name WaSiM-ETH; this name continues to be present on the official model web page, but the model should be referenced as \textit{WaSiM}. The model has an official versioning system (http://www.wasim.ch/en/the\_model/dev\_details.htm) but scientific papers do not always report the used version number version.


\textbf{wflow} is the modular and distributed hydrological modelling platform of DELTARES (\url{https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/wflow-hydrology/}). \textit{wflow\_hbv} is a fully distributed version of the conceptual HBV model \citep{Lindstrm1997} - applied on a grid basis - in the wflow framework with a kinematic wave as routing instead of the original triangular routing function; the model has an interception reservoir, snow module, root zone storage, fast runoff reservoir, and a groundwater reservoir \citep{deBoerEuser2017}.
